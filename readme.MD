For demo purposes only, when starting the application for the first time you need to configure
the following fields in the `local.properties` file:

API_TOKEN = "7b26542be3877933e385cad87a0e9974"
API = "http://api.exchangeratesapi.io/v1/"

In an enterprise application these should be hidden from the project.
